## Statannotations Tutorials

### Tutorial 1
This is the first tutorial in a series explaining in detail how to use 
[`statannotations`](https://github.com/trevismd/statannotations).

In this tutorial, we go over the basic annotations features of the package, by 
exploring part of the Kickstarter campaigns dataset. Specifically, we show

* How to add custom annotations
* How to add previously computed p-values and have statannotations format them
* How to use configure statannotations to both perform the statistical test and
add the results onto a plot.

You can find it as a jupyter notebook in this repository
[here](./Tutorial_1/Statannotations-Tutorial-1.ipynb), or as a post on 
Medium [here](https://medium.com/@trevismd/2bfce0394c00), which is based on the
notebook but was then further refined a little.
