## Statannotations Tutorials

### Tutorial 1
This is the first tutorial in a series explaining in detail how to use 
[`statannotations`](https://github.com/trevismd/statannotations) (v0.4).

In this tutorial, we go over the basic annotations features of the package, by 
exploring part of the Kickstarter campaigns dataset. Specifically, we show

* How to add custom annotations to a seaborn plot?
* How to automatically format previously computed p-values in several 
  ways, then add these to a plot in a single function call?
* How to both perform the statistical tests and add their results to a plot, 
  optionally applying a multiple comparisons correction method?

You can find it as a jupyter notebook in this repository on
[Tutorial_1/Statannotations-Tutorial-1.ipynb](./Tutorial_1/Statannotations-Tutorial-1.ipynb), 
or as a post on Medium [here](https://medium.com/@trevismd/2bfce0394c00), which
is based on the notebook but was then a little further refined.
